# Leave A Comment

This is the app I use for managing the "leave a comment" section of my website, where anonymous users can post to, and an admin can view and manage them.

## Repo-Parser
This repository is parse-able by my custom repo-parser. The contents of the `repo-parser-target` directory are meant to be consumed by an API using this package.
